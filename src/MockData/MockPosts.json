    "content": "React is a popular JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.\n\nOne of React's core concepts is the component-based architecture. Instead of writing one big HTML file, React encourages breaking the UI into reusable pieces called components. These components can manage their own state and be composed to build complex UIs.\n\nReact uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance. When data changes, React updates only the components that need re-rendering, making applications fast and responsive.\n\nTo get started with React, you can use Create React App:\n```bash\nnpx create-react-app my-app\ncd my-app\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis command sets up a development environment with everything you need: React, Webpack, Babel, and more.\n\nReact also supports JSX — a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript:\n```jsx\nconst Welcome = () => <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;\n```\n\nOverall, React is powerful, scalable, and widely used across the web industry. Whether you're building a small widget or a large application, React provides the tools to do it efficiently",

    "excerpt": "Learn how REST APIs work and how to consume them.",
    "content": "REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs are a standardized way for software applications to communicate over the internet. They allow client and server systems to exchange data using HTTP requests, making it easy to create, read, update, or delete information—commonly referred to as CRUD operations. REST APIs are designed around resources, which are identified by unique URLs, and they typically return data in JSON format. Because of their simplicity, scalability, and use of standard web protocols, REST APIs have become a popular choice for building web and mobile applications that need to interact with databases or other services. Understanding how to consume and build REST APIs is an essential skill for modern web development.",
